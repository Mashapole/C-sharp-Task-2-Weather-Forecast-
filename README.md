2nd year Work.

On this task-2 i adjust the weather forecasting application developed in Task 1 to appropriately store all data in 
files.

For weather forecasts the following should be stored in files:
• City;
• Date;
• Minimum temperature;
• Maximum temperature;
• Precipitation;
• Humidity;
• Wind speed.

Also make use of files to store login details for weather forecasters and general users. 
Once the necessary changes have been made to store all data in files, add the following 
functionality for weather forecasters:
• Allow weather forecasters to log in before capturing weather forecasts and viewing reports.
• Allow weather forecasters to view and edit captured weather forecasts.
• Reports should be written to file in order to allow the weather forecaster to print out the 
reports.
Also add the necessary functionality to allow regular users to log in to use the system. Regular 
users should not have access to the functionality available to weather forecasters. General users 
should be able to:
• Specify cities that they regularly want to view weather forecasts for.
• View weather forecasts for the specified cities.
